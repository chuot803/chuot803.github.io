                <p>This week I settled in to UIUC after making the long drive from Austin.
              To familiarize myself with some of the technology we might use for the project, I created a small game using the game engine Unity.
              This was pretty familiar to me, since I've built similar applications before. After that, I used Unity again to make a simple application 
              with the lab's VR headset, which was pretty fun to use! This week I also attended Scott's practice presentation for his qualifying exam,
               which I wish him luck for :) 
            </p></div>
            <div class="carousel-item"><p>On Tuesday I got to meet some of the other summer students in the parasol lab :) We all worked on
              getting the environment set up for running ROS2 and did the tutorials for using it. I am now learning about SLAM and how it can be
              used for mapping out an environment. I also attended a meeting about the Mind in Vitro project, which is exploring how we can use living
              neurons for computing. It seems like it could be a really interesting summer project. 
            </p></div>
            <div class="carousel-item"><p>This week I made a representation of a rectangular robot and was able to visualize its configuration space using tools in python.
              After that, I learned more about how search algorithms work and how they can be applied to motion planning in robotics. I also met with my mentor Victor
              and we talked about potential project ideas surrounding the contributions from VAMP, which parallelizes collision checking and forward kinematics using SIMD
              instructions on the CPU. I recently got VAMP to run locally, so we will be discussing the next steps soon.
            </p></div>
            <div class="carousel-item"><p>The other summer students and I finished the crash course lessons on graph search and motion planning this week. We learned a lot about
              the different algorithms used and their implementations. Victor and I are working to benchmark how fast VAMP's results are against our own library, so I finished
              a script that takes in their environment yaml and generates object files that are compatible with our library. As of now, we are waiting on the 
              files for the ur5 robot which we will hopefully recieve info on soon :) Also, for anyone who might be reading at UIUC, Suzu's Bakery in Champaign 
              is delicious and I recommend their matcha ice cream! My labmates and I went there and had a great time.
