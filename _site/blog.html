                <p>This week I settled in to UIUC after making the long drive from Austin.
              To familiarize myself with some of the technology we might use for the project, I created a small game using the game engine Unity.
              This was pretty familiar to me, since I've built similar applications before. After that, I used Unity again to make a simple application 
              with the lab's VR headset, which was pretty fun to use! This week I also attended Scott's practice presentation for his qualifying exam,
               which I wish him luck for :)

            <div class="carousel-item"><p>On Tuesday I got to meet some of the other summer students in the parasol lab :) We all worked on
              getting the environment set up for running ROS2 and did the tutorials for using it. I am now learning about SLAM and how it can be
              used for mapping out an environment. I also attended a meeting about the Mind in Vitro project, which is exploring how we can use living
              neurons for computing. It seems like it could be a really interesting summer project.
